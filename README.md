This macro automates a full sequence of steps in a continuous loop, performing each stage in order and restarting from the beginning once the last step is completed. The loop runs indefinitely until the Stop button is pressed, ensuring full control and safe interruption at any time.
So far, I’ve implemented the core logic of the macro, including the execution of multiple sequential steps and a looping system that restarts the routine automatically once all stages are completed. I also added control functions such as the Start and Stop buttons, ensuring the loop can run continuously or be interrupted safely at any time.

The next features I still need to implement are:

Detecting and locating a specific image on the screen (image recognition), which is not working properly yet.

Typing and sending a custom message defined by the user once all steps have finished.

These improvements will complete the automation flow and make the macro fully functional and customizable.
